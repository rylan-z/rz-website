				<h2>Wed 29 Aug 2007 : Iirrationality in argument</h2>
				<p><p>The truth is not found on the page, but is a wayward sprite that   bursts forth from the readers mind for reasons of its own. I once   thought that the Truth was a set comprised of all the things that   were true, and the big truth could be obtained by taking all its   component propositions and evaluating them until nothing remained. I   would approach my rhetorical battles as a logical reductionist,   tearing down, atomizing, proving, disproving, discarding falsehoods   and reassembling truths until the Truth was pure, golden and   unarguable. But then, when truth matters most, when truth is the   agent of freedom, I stood before Justice and with truth, lost   freedom. Here was something fantastical, unbelievable and impossible,   you could prove that (A =&gt; B) and (B =&gt; C) and (C =&gt; D) and  (D =&gt; F)   Justice would nod its head and agree, but then, when you turned to   claim your coup de grace, A =&gt; F irrevocably, Justice would demur and   revoke the axiom of transitivity, for Justice will not be told when F   stands for freedom. Transitivity is evoked when Justice imagines F   and finding the dream a pleasurable one sets about gathering cushions   to prop up their slumber. Here then is the truth about the Truth; the   Truth is not bridge, sturdy to every step, a marvel of bound planks   and supports from the known into the unknown, but a surging sea of   smashed wood, flotsam and drowning sailors. So first, always pick   your poetic metaphor, to make the reader want to believe, then the   facts, and -- miracle! -- transitivity will descend from heaven,   invoked as justification for prejudice. </p><p> Often we suffer to read, &quot;But if we believe X then we&apos;ll have to...&quot;,   or &quot;If we believe X it will lead to...&quot;. This has no reflection on   the veracity of X and so we see that outcomes are treated with more   reverence than the Truth. It stings us, but natural selection has   spun its ancestral yarns from physically realized outcomes, robustly   eschewing the vapor thread of platonism as an abomination against the   natural order, fit only for the gossip of monks and the page. </p><p> Yet just as we feel all hope is lost and we sink back into the   miasma, back to the shadow world of ghosts and gods, a miracle   arises; everywhere before the direction of self interest is known,   people yearn to see where its compass points and then they hunger for   truth with passion and beauty and insight. He loves me. He loves me   not. Here then is the truth to set them free. Free from the   manipulations and constraints of the mendacious. Free to choose their   path, free to remove the ring from their noses, free to look up into   the infinite voids and choose wonder over whatever gets them though.   And before this feeling to cast blessings on the profits and prophets   of truth, on the liberators and martyrs of truth, on the Voltaires,   Galileos, and Principias of truth, on the Gutenburgs, Marconis and   Internets of truth, on those serial killers of delusion, those   brutal, driven and obsessed miners of reality, smashing, smashing,   smashing every rotten edifice until all is ruins and the seeds of the   new.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p>
